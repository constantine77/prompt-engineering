1. Problem Statement:
Today, Apache Spark is a key tool for handling large amounts of data. But, thereâ€™s a big issue: optimizing Spark job performance. When not done right, this leads to long run times, wasted resources, and high costs. Fixing these performance problems requires a deep knowledge of Spark and can take a lot of time and effort.

2. Solution:
To tackle this problem, we plan to build a smart machine learning model. This model will use detailed Spark metrics to quickly find potential performance problems and then give clear, helpful advice on how to fix them. By using advanced machine learning and Spark metrics, we aim to make finding and fixing performance issues faster and easier, removing the need for deep Spark knowledge.

3. Impact:
The effect of our solution will be wide-reaching. It will make using resources in Apache Spark more efficient, cutting down costs and saving time. It will simplify the process of optimizing Spark jobs, allowing data professionals to concentrate on getting value from data instead of struggling with performance issues. By automating this process, we will make data processing workflows more efficient and adaptable, meeting the growing needs of data work.

In short, our goal is to make working with Apache Spark smoother and more efficient, allowing users to make the most out of it and pushing the limits of what can be achieved with large-scale data processing.
