Approach 1: SQL Wrapper Function in SparkSession
Implementation Plan:

Define Wrapper Function:

Create a custom function in SparkSession that can accept SQL statements.
The function should be able to parse and understand different types of SQL merge statements.
Integrate Governance Checks:

Within the wrapper function, incorporate code to perform data quality checks, schema validation, and tokenization.
Ensure that these checks are run before the actual merge happens.
SQL Execution:

Once the checks are passed, the function should pass the SQL statement to the underlying SQL execution engine in Spark.
Handle errors or exceptions that might occur during SQL execution.
Testing and Validation:

Test the function with different types of merge scenarios to ensure it handles all cases correctly.
Validate that governance checks are being applied correctly.
Documentation and Deployment:

Document the usage of the function and any limitations or considerations.
Deploy the function in your Spark environment and integrate it with existing workflows.
Approach 2: Custom Merge Command
Implementation Plan:

Design the Custom Command:

Develop a custom command or API that abstracts the merge operation.
Define the inputs, such as the DataFrame to be merged and any configuration parameters.
Implement Governance Checks:

Integrate data quality checks, schema validation, and tokenization processes within the command.
Ensure these checks are performed before merging the DataFrame with the target table.
Merge Logic:

Implement the logic to perform the actual merge operation, handling inserts and updates as needed.
Optimize the merge process for performance and reliability.
Testing and Optimization:

Test the command with various datasets and merge scenarios.
Optimize performance, handling large datasets and complex merge conditions.
Documentation and Deployment:

Document how to use the custom command, including any configurations and limitations.
Deploy the command in the Spark environment, ensuring compatibility with existing systems.
Approach 3: Custom Spark Extension for Logical Plan Modification
Implementation Plan:

Develop the Spark Extension:

Create a custom Spark extension that can intercept and modify the logical plan of Spark operations.
Focus on identifying and altering the logical plan for merge operations.
Integrate Governance Checks:

Implement the necessary code to perform data quality checks, schema validation, and tokenization as part of the logical plan modification.
Ensure these checks are executed before the merge operation in the logical plan.
Modify Logical Plan for Merge:

Customize the extension to recognize and override merge commands in the logical plan.
Replace standard merge operations with your version that includes governance checks.
Testing and Compatibility Checks:

Thoroughly test the extension with different Spark versions and configurations.
Ensure that it works correctly with various data formats and merge scenarios.
Documentation and Deployment:

Document the extension, including how to install, configure, and use it in a Spark environment.
Deploy the extension in your Spark cluster, ensuring it integrates well with the existing setup.
