The sparkMeasure library and Spark listeners are commonly used tools for capturing performance metrics in Apache Spark. Here's a breakdown of what you can capture with these tools:

1. sparkMeasure:
sparkMeasure is a tool for performance troubleshooting in Apache Spark. It allows you to easily capture and analyze:

Task Metrics:

Execution time.
CPU time.
Bytes read/written.
Shuffle read/write metrics.
Memory consumption.
Stage Metrics:

Number of tasks.
Shuffle read/write metrics.
Input metrics.
Disk spilled.
Time taken.
Job Metrics:

Number of stages.
Active and completed stages.
Job duration.
Associated SQL if available.


2. Spark Listeners:
Spark listeners provide a way to capture various events during the lifecycle of a Spark application. By extending the org.apache.spark.scheduler.SparkListener interface, you can track:

onJobStart:

Capture when a new job starts.
Details about the associated stages and tasks.
onJobEnd:

Capture metrics when a job ends.
Reason for job completion (success, failure, etc.)
onStageCompleted:

Details of the stage's tasks.
Accumulable info (like internal metrics on bytes read, written, etc.)
Execution and completion time.
onTaskStart:

Capture when a task starts.
Info about task attempt and associated stage.
onTaskEnd:

Task metrics, such as:
Executor CPU time.
Disk bytes spilled.
JVM garbage collection time.
Result size, peak execution memory.
Task result status (SUCCESS, FAILED, KILLED).
onApplicationStart and onApplicationEnd:

Capture the start and end of the entire Spark application.
Application name, ID, and timestamps.
onExecutorAdded and onExecutorRemoved:

Track when executors are added or removed.
Reason for removal.
onEnvironmentUpdate:

Details about Spark environment, configuration, and versions.

3. Combining with Manual Runtime Metrics:
When integrating metrics from sparkMeasure and Spark listeners, consider also manually capturing:

User-defined Metrics: Using Spark's accumulator feature, users can define custom metrics that get updated during task execution and can be retrieved post-execution.

External System Latencies: If your Spark job communicates with external systems (databases, APIs, etc.), measure the latency or time taken for these operations.

Error Rates: Manually capture errors or exceptions that are not automatically captured by the built-in metrics, especially those related to business logic or custom operations.

Resource Utilization Over Time: Especially in clustered environments, you might want to capture the CPU, memory, and network usage over the course of a Spark job's execution.

By aggregating data from sparkMeasure, Spark listeners, and manual metrics, you can get a comprehensive view of your application's performance, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize accordingly.
