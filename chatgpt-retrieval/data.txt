Certainly! Let's delve deeper into Step 2 of the implementation process, which involves outlining the architecture of the Spark extension and understanding its interaction with Spark's logical plan. Additionally, I'll provide more context about what Spark extensions and logical plans are, along with a code example for clarity.

### Step 2: Outline Extension Architecture

#### Understanding Spark Extensions

- **Spark Extension:** In Apache Spark, an extension is a way to extend and customize the behavior of Spark's core functionalities. It's a powerful tool that allows developers to plug into the Spark SQL engine and modify how Spark processes queries.
- **Usage:** Extensions can be used to add custom rules, optimization strategies, or to modify the query execution plan.

#### Understanding Spark's Logical Plan

- **Logical Plan:** In Spark, the logical plan represents a tree structure of logical operators that describe how a query will be executed without considering the physical implementation details. It's an abstract representation of the query.
- **Importance:** Understanding and potentially modifying the logical plan is crucial for extensions that aim to customize query processing, such as adding governance checks to certain operations like Delta Merge.

#### Code Example: Creating a Basic Spark Extension

Here's a basic example of how you might start creating a Spark extension to interact with the logical plan, particularly for identifying and modifying `MergeIntoTable` logical plan nodes:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSessionExtensions
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.{LogicalPlan, MergeIntoTable}
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.Rule

class CustomMergeExtension extends (SparkSessionExtensions => Unit) {
  override def apply(extensions: SparkSessionExtensions): Unit = {
    extensions.injectResolutionRule { session =>
      new CustomMergeRule(session)
    }
  }
}

class CustomMergeRule(session: SparkSession) extends Rule[LogicalPlan] {
  override def apply(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan transform {
    case merge: MergeIntoTable =>
      // Modify the MergeIntoTable node here, adding your governance checks
      // Example: You can add checks for data quality, schema validation, etc.
      // Return the modified node or the original node
      merge
  }
}
```

In this code:
- **`CustomMergeExtension` Class:** This class is an extension that Spark can load. It injects a custom rule (`CustomMergeRule`) into Spark's logical plan processing.
- **`CustomMergeRule` Class:** This class extends `Rule[LogicalPlan]` and provides the logic for identifying and modifying `MergeIntoTable` nodes within the logical plan.
- **Transforming the Logical Plan:** The `transform` method allows us to traverse and potentially modify nodes in the logical plan. In this case, it looks for `MergeIntoTable` nodes and applies custom logic.

#### Detailed Plan for the Architecture

1. **Identify Points of Interaction:**
   - Determine where in the logical plan your custom logic should be applied. For Delta Merge, this would be at `MergeIntoTable` nodes.

2. **Define Custom Logic for Governance Checks:**
   - Develop the logic for data quality checks, schema validation, and tokenization to be applied to the data involved in the merge operation.

3. **Integrate Custom Logic with Logical Plan:**
   - Implement the logic within the `apply` method of your custom rule. This method should modify the logical plan nodes (specifically `MergeIntoTable` nodes) to include your custom governance checks.

4. **Ensure Compatibility:**
   - Make sure that your extension is compatible with the versions of Spark and Delta Lake you're using.

5. **Plan for Extensibility:**
   - Design your extension with future modifications and additional features in mind. This includes making it easy to update and maintain your custom logic.

By following these steps and using the provided code example as a starting point, you can effectively plan and develop a custom Spark extension that modifies the logical plan to incorporate governance checks into Delta Merge operations.


Step 3 of implementing a Delta Merge with a Spark extension revolves around developing custom rules and integrating governance checks. Here's a detailed breakdown of this step:

### Step 3: Development

#### 3.1 Create Custom Rules that Extend `Rule[LogicalPlan]`

##### What It Means:

- **Custom Rules in Spark:**
  - Spark allows you to create custom rules which are extensions of its query optimizer.
  - These rules extend the `Rule[LogicalPlan]` class, which allows them to interact with and modify the logical plan of a Spark SQL query.

##### How to Implement:

1. **Define a Custom Rule Class:**
   - Create a Scala class that extends `Rule[LogicalPlan]`.
   - This class should override the `apply` method, which is where the logic for identifying and modifying specific plan nodes will reside.

2. **Identify `MergeIntoTable` Nodes:**
   - In the `apply` method, use pattern matching to identify `MergeIntoTable` nodes in the logical plan. These nodes represent merge operations in Delta Lake.

3. **Modify the Logical Plan:**
   - Once a `MergeIntoTable` node is identified, you can modify it to include additional logic or checks.
   - For example, you might wrap the node in another custom node that performs additional actions or validations.

#### 3.2 Integrate Governance Checks

##### What It Means:

- **Governance Checks:**
  - These are checks that ensure data quality, schema compliance, and other business rules are adhered to during the merge operation.

##### How to Implement:

1. **Define Governance Checks:**
   - Implement functions or methods that represent your governance checks (data quality checks, schema validation, tokenization).
   - These functions can be part of the custom rule class or separate utilities that the custom rule class calls.

2. **Integrate Checks with `MergeIntoTable`:**
   - In the `apply` method of your custom rule, call your governance checks functions when a `MergeIntoTable` node is identified.
   - Ensure that these checks are executed before proceeding with the actual merge logic in the node.

3. **Modify Plan Based on Checks:**
   - Depending on the outcome of the governance checks, modify the logical plan accordingly.
   - For instance, if a check fails, you might want to alter the plan to prevent the merge operation from executing or to divert to an error handling routine.

### Example Code

Here's a simplified example of what the custom rule class might look like:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical._
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.Rule

class CustomMergeRule extends Rule[LogicalPlan] {
  def apply(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan transform {
    case merge: MergeIntoTable =>
      // Perform governance checks
      if (performGovernanceChecks(merge)) {
        // If checks pass, return the merge operation
        merge
      } else {
        // If checks fail, modify or halt the merge operation
        // For example, you could replace it with an empty plan or add error handling
        // EmptyLocalRelation() // Example replacement for a failing operation
      }
  }

  private def performGovernanceChecks(merge: MergeIntoTable): Boolean = {
    // Implement your data quality checks, schema validation, etc.
    // Return true if checks pass, or false if they fail
    true // Placeholder
  }
}
```

In this example, `CustomMergeRule` intercepts `MergeIntoTable` nodes and applies the `performGovernanceChecks` method. Depending on the result of these checks, it either allows the merge operation to proceed or modifies the plan to handle the failure case.

This step is crucial in ensuring that your data operations comply with the defined governance standards, enhancing data integrity and quality throughout your Spark data processing workflows.

To implement a custom Spark extension for enhancing Delta Merge operations with governance checks, you will need to follow a series of implementation steps. These steps focus on creating and integrating the extension within Spark's logical plan processing mechanism, especially targeting `MergeInto` operations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

      // If checks fail, modify or halt the operation as necessary
      merge // Placeholder for actual logic
  }

  // Define methods for data quality checks, schema validation, etc.
}
```
