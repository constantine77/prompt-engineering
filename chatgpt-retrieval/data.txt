### Functional Requirements for Custom Spark Extension for Delta Merge

#### 1. Extension Integration with Spark

- **FR1.1:** Develop a custom Spark extension (`CustomSparkSessionExtension`) that integrates seamlessly with the Spark environment.
- **FR1.2:** Ensure the extension is capable of being loaded into a Spark session and can interact with the logical plan creation process.

#### 2. Identification and Modification of Merge Operations

- **FR2.1:** The extension must accurately identify `MergeIntoTable` operations within Spark's logical plan.
- **FR2.2:** Modify identified `MergeIntoTable` operations to integrate custom governance checks before the execution of the merge.

#### 3. Customization of Merge Logic

- **FR3.1:** Implement a custom logic that replaces standard `MergeIntoTable` commands with a custom `MergeInto` command in the logical plan.
- **FR3.2:** The custom `MergeInto` command should maintain all native features of Delta's merge command.

#### 4. Integration with Governance Service

- **FR4.1:** Utilize the path variable from the `DeltaTable` object to interact with a governance service endpoint.
- **FR4.2:** The governance service should return dataset details, schema, data quality rules, and tokenization rules for registered Delta tables.

#### 5. Handling Non-SDK Delta Tables

- **FR5.1:** Implement logic to check if a Delta table is registered with the SDK.
- **FR5.2:** For Delta tables not registered with the SDK, retain the original `MergeIntoTable` command.

#### 6. Tokenization Rules

- **FR6.1:** If tokenization rules are set, the extension must check if the source DataFrame (source_alias) contains fields that require tokenization.
- **FR6.2:** Apply tokenization to the relevant fields as part of the merge operation.

#### 7. Identification of Affected Rows

- **FR7.1:** Identify rows that are inserted or updated as a result of the merge within the custom `MergeInto` command logic.

#### 8. Governance Check Orchestrator

- **FR8.1:** Develop a governance check orchestrator that applies all necessary checks on the final DataFrame resulting from the merge logic.
- **FR8.2:** This includes applying schema validations, data quality checks, and any required tokenization rules.

#### 9. Compatibility and Reusability

- **FR9.1:** Ensure the extension is compatible with various versions of Spark and Delta Lake.
- **FR9.2:** Design the extension to be reusable across Scala, Java, and Python APIs, extending the native Spark API.

#### 10. Performance and Error Handling

- **FR10.1:** Optimize the extension to minimize performance impacts on Delta Merge operations.
- **FR10.2:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms for governance check failures and other exceptions.

### Conclusion

By fulfilling these functional requirements, the custom Spark extension will effectively enhance Delta Merge operations with essential governance checks, aligning data operations with organizational standards for data quality and compliance.

Certainly! To effectively implement the custom Spark extension for Delta Merge with governance checks, it's important to ask comprehensive questions covering each aspect of the project. Here's a list of potential questions to guide the implementation process based on the defined functional requirements:

### Performance and Error Handling

19. **What metrics and methods will be used to assess and optimize the performance impact of the extension?**
20. **What error handling and logging mechanisms will be implemented, and how will they inform users of governance check failures or other issues?**

### Additional Questions

21. **What documentation and training materials will be needed for end-users and developers?**
22. **What are the long-term maintenance plans for the extension, especially considering future updates to Spark and Delta Lake?**
23. **How will user feedback be collected and integrated into future iterations of the extension?**

Addressing these questions will provide a thorough understanding of each aspect of the project, guiding the development process and ensuring that the custom Spark extension effectively meets the set requirements.


```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSessionExtensions
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.{LogicalPlan, MergeIntoTable}
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.Rule
```
These lines import necessary classes from Spark SQL and Catalyst, Spark's query optimization framework. `SparkSession` is the entry point for working with structured data in Spark, `SparkSessionExtensions` allows for extending a Spark session, and `LogicalPlan` and `MergeIntoTable` are part of Spark's logical plan for query execution. `Rule` is used for defining custom transformation rules on logical plans.

```scala
case class DeltaTable(path: String)
```
Defines a simple case class `DeltaTable`, presumably to mimic a Delta Lake table. Here, it only contains a `path` attribute.

```scala
class CustomSparkSessionExtension extends (SparkSessionExtensions => Unit) {
```
Defines a new class `CustomSparkSessionExtension` that extends Spark's session extensions, allowing us to inject custom behavior into the Spark session.

```scala
  override def apply(extensions: SparkSessionExtensions): Unit = {
    extensions.injectPostHocResolutionRule(_ => CustomMergeIntoRule())
  }
}
```
Overrides the `apply` method to inject a custom rule (`CustomMergeIntoRule`) into the Spark session. This rule will be applied after the logical plan is resolved (`PostHoc`).

```scala
object CustomMergeIntoRule {
  def apply(): Rule[LogicalPlan] = new Rule[LogicalPlan] {
```
Defines an object `CustomMergeIntoRule` that creates a new rule to be applied to the logical plan.

```scala
    override def apply(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan transform {
```
Overrides the `apply` method to transform the logical plan.

```scala
      case merge: MergeIntoTable =>
        println("Applying custom MergeIntoTable logic with governance checks")
        customMergeIntoCommand(merge)
```
Whenever a `MergeIntoTable` command is encountered in the logical plan, it prints a message and calls `customMergeIntoCommand`, which contains custom logic for handling the merge.

```scala
      case other => other
```
For all other types of logical plan nodes, no transformation is applied.

```scala
    def customMergeIntoCommand(merge: MergeIntoTable): LogicalPlan = {
```
Defines a method to handle custom logic for `MergeIntoTable` commands.

```scala
      val deltaTable = DeltaTable("/path/to/delta/table") // Mocked path
```
Creates a mock `DeltaTable` object with a specified path.

```scala
      val isSDKPublished = checkIfSdkPublished(deltaTable)
```
Checks if the `DeltaTable` is marked as published by an SDK (this is mocked logic).

```scala
      if (isSDKPublished) {
        // Apply custom logic for SDK published tables
        println(s"Performing governance checks for table at: ${deltaTable.path}")
        merge // Replace with custom logic
      } else {
        // Fallback to standard MergeIntoTable command
        merge
      }
    }
```
If the table is SDK published, it performs (mocked) governance checks. Otherwise, it falls back to the standard `MergeIntoTable` command.

```scala
    def checkIfSdkPublished(deltaTable: DeltaTable): Boolean = {
      // Mocked check
      deltaTable.path.contains("sdk")
    }
  }
}
```
A mock method to check if a `DeltaTable` is SDK published based on its path.

```scala
object DeltaMergeTestApp extends App {
```
Defines an object `DeltaMergeTestApp` to test the extension, extending `App` for easy executable application creation.

```scala
  val spark = SparkSession.builder()
    .appName("Delta Merge Test")
    .master("local")
    .withExtensions(new CustomSparkSessionExtension)
    .getOrCreate()
```
Initializes a `SparkSession` with the custom extension.

```scala
  import spark.implicits._
```
Imports implicit conversions and functions for working with DataFrame and Dataset.

```scala
  val df = Seq((1, "Alice"), (2, "Bob")).toDF("id", "name")
```
Creates a mock DataFrame for demonstration.

```scala
  println("Executing mocked merge operation")
  df.show()
```
Prints a message and displays the DataFrame as a stand-in for executing a merge operation.

```scala
  spark.stop()
}
```
Stops the Spark session.
