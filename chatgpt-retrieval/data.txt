### Summary of Solution 2

Solution 2 is a strategy to handle schema drift detection in Delta Lake by leveraging the current execution process. The core idea is to use an existing set of schemas already flagged by the system as potentially containing breaking changes. Each of these schemas will be applied to a temporary Delta table to verify whether the changes can be incorporated or if they result in a failure, indicative of a breaking change. This method hinges on Delta Lake's inherent behavior of enforcing schema consistency. If a schema change breaks the table, it indicates a true breaking change. The outcome of this exercise will be a consolidated list of schemas that are confirmed to introduce breaking changes. Schemas that do not result in failures can be ignored or discarded, thus refining the list to only those changes that are critical and need attention.

### Development Steps for Implementation of Solution 2

1. **Schema Collection**:
   - Compile a list of all schema versions flagged by the current execution process for potential breaking changes.

2. **Temporary Delta Table Creation**:
   - Set up a process to create a temporary Delta table in an isolated environment where schema changes can be tested.

3. **Schema Application Testing**:
   - Sequentially apply each schema from the collected list to the temporary Delta table.
   - Record the outcome of each application to determine if the schema is accepted or causes the table to break.

4. **Result Consolidation**:
   - Aggregate the results from the schema application tests.
   - Isolate the schemas that caused the table to break, confirming them as true breaking changes.

5. **Schema List Refinement**:
   - Discard the schemas that did not cause any issues when applied, as they do not represent breaking changes.
   - Finalize the list of breaking-change schemas.

6. **Automated Scripting**:
   - Develop automated scripts or tools to handle the testing and consolidation process to streamline operations for future schema drift detections.

7. **Integration with MigrationAutomation Job**:
   - Integrate the new process into the existing MigrationAutomation job workflow.
   - Ensure the workflow includes the registration of confirmed breaking-change schemas for data migration.

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of the new process to ensure accuracy in identifying breaking changes.
   - Perform quality assurance checks to validate the integration with the existing system.

9. **Documentation and Training**:
   - Update the system documentation to include the new process for identifying breaking changes.
   - Train relevant personnel on the updated workflow and how to interpret the results.

10. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
    - Deploy the updated Crawler API with the new enhancement in place.
    - Monitor the system to ensure it accurately identifies breaking changes and integrates well with the overall data migration process.

By following these steps, you will be able to enhance the Delta Lake Crawler API to more effectively and efficiently identify true breaking changes in the schema, aiding in the data migration and schema evolution management.


### Summary of Solution 1

Solution 1 focuses on enhancing the existing Crawler API specifically to detect a singular type of schema drift, considered a breaking change for Delta Lake: the addition of a non-nullable column without a default value to a dataset. This change diverges from the API's current functionality that captures all types of schema changes. The new enhancement will streamline the process to focus only on this specific change, thereby simplifying the identification of breaking changes and reducing the number of false positives in schema versioning.

### Development Steps for Implementation of Solution 1

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Define what constitutes a non-nullable column addition as a breaking change within the context of Delta Lake.
   - Establish criteria for the detection of such changes.

2. **API Specification Update**:
   - Revise the Crawler API specifications to include the detection of non-nullable column additions.
   - Update the documentation to reflect this narrowed scope of breaking changes.

3. **Design Schema Change Detection Logic**:
   - Design a logic module within the Crawler that can compare historical schema versions to the current schema, looking specifically for additions of non-nullable columns.
   - Ensure this module can access and interpret Delta Lake metadata.

4. **Development of Detection Module**:
   - Implement the schema change detection logic within the existing Crawler codebase.
   - Test the module in isolation to ensure accurate detection.

5. **Integration with MigrationAutomation Job**:
   - Integrate the new detection logic into the MigrationAutomation job workflow.
   - Ensure it correctly flags datasets with the specific breaking change and tracks associated files.

6. **Database and Tracking Updates**:
   - Modify the tracking system to document instances of the breaking change.
   - Update database schemas or records to include new versioning information tied to this change.

7. **Testing**:
   - Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the enhanced Crawler API accurately identifies the targeted breaking change.
   - Validate the system's ability to register schema versions and manage data migrations based on the new logic.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the updated Crawler API in a controlled environment.
   - Monitor for unexpected behavior and validate performance against known datasets.

9. **Feedback and Iteration**:
   - Collect feedback from end-users and stakeholders on the updated functionality.
   - Iterate on the design and implementation based on feedback and observed system behavior.

10. **Documentation and Training**:
    - Create detailed documentation for the updated Crawler functionality.
    - Train technical teams and stakeholders on how to use the updated system and interpret its outputs.

11. **Monitoring and Support**:
    - Establish monitoring for the new Crawler behavior to quickly identify and address any issues.
    - Set up a support process for users encountering issues related to the new breaking change detection.

By following these steps, the Crawler API will be adept at detecting critical schema changes, particularly the addition of non-nullable columns without default values, thereby enabling a more focused and efficient approach to managing schema drift in Delta Lake environments.

####Development:

Implementing Solution 2 involves creating a systematic process for applying potential schema changes to a temporary Delta table to confirm if they constitute breaking changes. Below is a detailed implementation plan that includes architecture considerations and code examples where applicable.

### Implementation Plan for Solution 2

#### Architecture and System Design

1. **Schema Repository Setup**:
   - Establish a repository where all schema versions are stored. This can be a version-controlled environment or a database system that logs schema changes over time.

2. **Temporary Delta Table Environment**:
   - Configure a dedicated Delta Lake environment or sandbox where temporary Delta tables can be created and manipulated without affecting production data.

3. **Automated Schema Application Framework**:
   - Develop a framework that can programmatically apply schemas to the temporary Delta table. This could be a script or a standalone application that interfaces with Delta Lake.

#### Code Implementation

4. **Schema Collection**:
   ```scala
   // Assume `SchemaVersionRepository` is a class that interacts with the schema repository
   val schemaRepo = new SchemaVersionRepository()
   val potentialBreakingSchemas = schemaRepo.getFlaggedSchemas()
   ```

5. **Temporary Delta Table Creation**:
   ```scala
   // Code snippet to create a temporary Delta table
   val tempTableName = s"temp_delta_${UUID.randomUUID()}"
   spark.sql(s"CREATE TABLE $tempTableName (...)")
   ```

6. **Schema Application Testing**:
   ```scala
   // Pseudocode for applying schema changes and testing
   potentialBreakingSchemas.foreach { schema =>
     try {
       applySchemaToTemporaryTable(tempTableName, schema)
       println(s"Schema ${schema.id} applied successfully.")
     } catch {
       case e: Exception => println(s"Schema ${schema.id} caused a breaking change.")
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Result Consolidation**:
   ```scala
   // Pseudocode for isolating breaking changes
   val breakingChanges = potentialBreakingSchemas.filter(isBreakingChange)
   ```

8. **Schema List Refinement**:
   - Use the test results to refine the list of schemas, retaining only those that cause the temporary Delta table to break.

9. **Automated Scripting**:
   ```bash
   # Example of a shell script to automate schema testing
   #!/bin/bash
   for schema in $(get_potential_breaking_schemas); do
     test_schema_application $schema
   done
   ```

10. **Integration with MigrationAutomation Job**:
    - Update the MigrationAutomation job's logic to include the validation of breaking changes using the newly developed process.

#### Quality Assurance

11. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
    - Develop test cases to cover different breaking scenarios.
    - Create a continuous integration pipeline to run tests automatically.

12. **Documentation and Training**:
    - Document the architecture, the flow of data, and the process in a system design document.
    - Prepare training materials for users and administrators of the Crawler API.

13. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
    - Use deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines to deploy the updated Crawler API.
    - Implement monitoring and alerting tools to track the performance and accuracy of the breaking change detection.

By following these steps and incorporating the provided code snippets, the development team can enhance the Delta Lake Crawler API to identify schema drift and breaking changes efficiently. The architecture should support a modular approach, allowing for isolated testing and clear separation between the testing environment and production data.
