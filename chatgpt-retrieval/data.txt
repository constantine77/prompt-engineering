To implement the injected post-resolution rule for analyzing and modifying the logical plan in a Spark session, we'll focus on the steps involving the detection and alteration of `MergeIntoTable` commands. This rule will be part of a custom Spark session extension. Here's how you can implement each step with code examples:

### Step 1: Injected Rule Post-Resolution MergeRule Parses Logical Plan

First, you need to create a custom rule that will analyze the logical plan and look for `MergeIntoTable` commands.

#### Custom Rule Implementation

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.Rule
import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.{LogicalPlan, MergeIntoTable}

object PostMergeRule extends Rule[LogicalPlan] {
  def apply(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan transform {
    case mergeInto: MergeIntoTable =>
      // Proceed to check if the table is Delta and if it's published by OSDG
      handleMergeInto(mergeInto)
    case other => other // No modification for other types of commands
  }

  def handleMergeInto(mergeInto: MergeIntoTable): LogicalPlan = {
    // Implement logic to check for Delta MergeIntoCommand and OSDG publishing
    // For now, returning the original command for simplicity
    mergeInto
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Check if Contains Delta MergeIntoCommand

In the `handleMergeInto` method, implement logic to check if the `MergeIntoTable` command is for a Delta table. This can be inferred from the table's metadata or the format of the table.

### Step 3: Call Governance Endpoint if OSDG Published

If the Delta table is identified as being published by OSDG (One Stream Data Governance), you would make an API call to your governance service.

#### Example of Making an API Call (Simplified)

```scala
import scala.io.Source
import scala.util.Try

def callGovernanceService(tablePath: String): Boolean = {
  val endpoint = s"http://your-governance-service/api?tablePath=$tablePath"
  Try(Source.fromURL(endpoint).mkString).isSuccess
  // You need to replace this with actual logic to parse the response and determine if the table is published by OSDG
}
```

### Step 4: Swap Delta Command `MergeIntoTable` for `OneStreamMergeCommand`

If the table is a Delta table and is published by OSDG, replace the `MergeIntoTable` command with a custom command that incorporates your governance checks.

#### Creating a Custom Command

```scala
case class OneStreamMergeCommand(originalCommand: MergeIntoTable) extends LogicalPlan {
  // Copy child nodes from the original command
  override def children: Seq[LogicalPlan] = originalCommand.children

  // Implement the custom merge logic with governance checks
  // ...
}
```

### Step 5: Apply Custom Command or Retain Original Plan

In the `handleMergeInto` method, apply the custom command if conditions are met; otherwise, retain the original logical plan.

#### Applying the Custom Logic

```scala
def handleMergeInto(mergeInto: MergeIntoTable): LogicalPlan = {
  val deltaTablePath = extractPathFromMergeInto(mergeInto)
  if (isDeltaTable(deltaTablePath) && callGovernanceService(deltaTablePath)) {
    OneStreamMergeCommand(mergeInto) // Apply the custom merge command
  } else {
    mergeInto // Retain the original command
  }
}
```
