### 1. Maven Profiles for Different Dependency Versions

**Description:**
- Maven profiles can be used to create different build configurations within the same project. Each profile can specify a set of dependencies and their versions. This way, you can create profiles for different versions of Spark, Delta Lake, or other dependencies.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Flexibility:** Allows switching between different configurations easily.
- **Simplicity:** Integrates seamlessly with the existing Maven build setup.
- **Isolation:** Keeps different configurations separate, reducing the risk of conflicts.

### 2. Multi-Module Maven Project

**Description:**
- A multi-module Maven project structure can be used, where each module is dedicated to a specific version of a dependency. Common code can be placed in a shared module.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Modularity:** Promotes clean separation of code for different versions.
- **Reusability:** The shared module can contain common code, reducing duplication.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update specific parts of the SDK independently.

### 3. Maven Dependency Management with Property Placeholders

**Description:**
- Using Maven's dependency management section with property placeholders allows defining dependency versions in properties. These properties can then be overridden in profiles or command-line arguments to build against different versions.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Centralized Control:** Offers a centralized way to manage dependency versions.
- **Ease of Update:** Changing a version in one place updates it across the project.
- **Build Versatility:** Enables building against different versions without changing the core `pom.xml` file.

### 4. Cross-Build Plugins for Scala

**Description:**
- Utilize cross-build plugins specific to Scala, like `sbt-doge`, to cross-compile Scala code against multiple Scala versions. This is particularly useful if the SDK needs to support different Scala versions used by Spark.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Scala-Specific:** Tailored for Scala projects, offering better compatibility.
- **Community Support:** Plugins like `sbt-doge` are widely used in the Scala community.
- **Cross-Scala Compatibility:** Essential if supporting multiple Scala versions is a priority.

### 5. Reflection or Dynamic Loading

**Description:**
- Using reflection or dynamic class loading in Scala to load different versions of classes or methods at runtime based on the environment or configuration.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Runtime Flexibility:** Allows the SDK to adapt to the environment at runtime.
- **Reduced Build Complexity:** Eliminates the need for multiple build configurations.
- **Avoids Binary Incompatibility:** Useful when API differences between versions are minimal.

### Conclusion

The choice among these solutions depends on your specific requirements, such as the extent of differences between dependency versions, the importance of isolating these versions, and the need to support multiple Scala versions. A combination of these strategies might be necessary for complex scenarios. For example, Maven profiles can be used for minor differences, while a multi-module setup can handle more significant version divergences. Regularly updating and testing against the latest versions of dependencies is crucial, regardless of the chosen approach.

### 1. Maven Profiles

**Description:** 
Maven Profiles allow you to customize the build process for different environments. You can define multiple profiles in your `pom.xml`, each targeting a different version of Spark and Scala. Each profile can specify its own dependencies, properties, and build configurations.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Flexibility:** Easily switch between different configurations for building against various versions.
- **Ease of Use:** Straightforward to set up within the existing Maven framework.
- **Clarity:** Profiles provide a clear separation of configurations for different versions.

### 2. SBT Cross-Building (For Scala Projects)

**Description:** 
SBT (Simple Build Tool) is popular in the Scala community and supports cross-building against different Scala versions. While primarily used for Scala, it can be integrated with Maven or replace Maven for Scala-specific modules.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Scala-Focused:** Offers better support for Scala-specific build requirements.
- **Community Support:** Widely used in the Scala community, providing various plugins and integrations.
- **Cross-Version Compatibility:** Efficient for building artifacts compatible with multiple Scala versions.

### 3. Multi-Module Maven Project

**Description:** 
Organize your project into multiple modules, where each module targets a specific combination of Spark and Scala versions. Shared code can be placed in a common module and included as a dependency in version-specific modules.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Modularity:** Enhances code organization and separation of concerns.
- **Reusability:** Shared code is maintained in one place, reducing duplication.
- **Targeted Builds:** Each module can be built independently, targeting specific version requirements.

### 4. Shade Plugin

**Description:** 
Maven's Shade Plugin can be used to create an uber-jar containing all dependencies, renamed and relocated to prevent conflicts. This approach can help manage transitive dependency conflicts that arise due to version differences.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Dependency Conflict Resolution:** Helps resolve issues arising from conflicting versions of dependencies.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Produces a single, self-contained artifact.
- **Namespace Management:** Relocates classes to prevent classpath issues.

### 5. Reflection or Dynamic Class Loading

**Description:** 
Utilize reflection or dynamic class loading in your SDK to load and execute code based on the runtime version of Spark and Scala. This allows your SDK to adapt to different versions at runtime without needing multiple builds.

**Why Consider It:**
- **Runtime Flexibility:** Adapts to the environment's version at runtime.
- **Avoids Multiple Builds:** Reduces the need to create different builds for each version.
- **Complexity Management:** Useful when differences between versions are not extensive.

### Conclusion

Each approach has its strengths and is suited to different scenarios. For instance, Maven profiles and multi-module projects offer a clear and structured way to manage different versions, while SBT cross-building is more Scala-centric. The Shade Plugin and reflection provide solutions to manage dependencies and runtime adaptability. Your choice will depend on the specific requirements of your SDK, the extent of version differences, and your team's familiarity with these tools. It's also common to use a combination of these strategies to achieve the desired outcome.
