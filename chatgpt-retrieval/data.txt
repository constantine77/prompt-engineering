1. Identifying Product Relations in Datasets
Objective: Use GenAI and RAG to identify which products are related to given datasets, automating what would typically be a lengthy manual process by data analysts.

Approach:

Data Preparation: First, you need to prepare your datasets and any metadata associated with them, such as field descriptions, usage logs, or previous analysis documents.
Knowledge Base Creation: Develop a comprehensive knowledge base that includes information about all products, their features, typical data patterns, and any historical dataset-product links.
RAG Model Setup: Train a RAG model that uses the knowledge base to understand and infer which product a dataset is most likely related to. The model retrieves relevant product information based on the dataset’s characteristics and uses this information to make an informed prediction.
Integration and Feedback Loop: Integrate this system into your data management workflow so that as datasets are imported or updated, the model automatically suggests potential product links. Implement a feedback mechanism where data analysts can confirm or correct the model’s predictions to improve accuracy over time.
Implementation Steps:

Collect and organize dataset descriptions and any available metadata.
Construct a detailed knowledge base about the products.
Train a RAG model using this knowledge base to infer relations between datasets and products.
Deploy this model into your data management system.
Set up a feedback loop for continuous learning and model refinement.
2. Schema Advisor for Developers
Objective: Assist developers in identifying different schema versions for datasets during development, streamlining database management and maintenance.

Approach:

Schema Repository: Maintain a central repository of all schema versions. This repository should be well-documented and accessible.
RAG-Based Schema Matching: Develop a RAG model that can suggest the most relevant schema versions for a given dataset by retrieving and comparing information from the schema repository. The model should consider various factors like data types, field names, historical changes, and version compatibilities.
Developer Tools Integration: Integrate this schema advisor solution into the development environments or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that developers use. This can be through plugins or API calls.
Usage Tracking and Updates: Track how developers use different schemas and update the RAG model and repository based on this usage and any new schema changes.
Implementation Steps:

Set up and maintain a detailed schema repository.
Train a RAG model to understand and match dataset characteristics with appropriate schema versions.
Integrate the schema advisor into the development tools used by your team.
Implement monitoring and updating mechanisms for continuous improvement of the tool.
