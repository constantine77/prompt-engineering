When implementing cross-build capabilities in an SDK, especially in a multi-team environment where different components like Delta Merge functionality are being developed, several types of rework or adjustments may be necessary. Assuming your team is working on the Delta Merge functionality using Scala and Maven and another team is adding cross-build capabilities, here are some potential areas of rework or attention:

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Review and potentially update dependencies in your Scala project to ensure compatibility with the cross-build setup.
   - Maven configuration files (`pom.xml`) might need adjustments to align with the cross-build environment, ensuring that dependencies are correctly resolved for different build targets.

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Update the build configuration files (such as `build.sbt` for Scala) to align with the new cross-build process.
   - Ensure that the Maven build lifecycle is correctly configured to handle the cross-build process, especially if you’re targeting multiple Scala versions.

3. **Code Compatibility**:
   - Refactor the code if necessary to ensure compatibility with different versions of Scala, especially if the cross-build setup targets multiple versions.
   - Address any deprecated functions or features that might not be compatible across different Scala versions.

4. **Testing**:
   - Update or add new tests to cover the cross-build scenarios. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and any necessary regression tests.
   - Ensure that the testing frameworks and tools used are compatible with the cross-build setup.

5. **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
   - Adjust CI/CD pipelines to accommodate the cross-build process. This might include updating build scripts, Dockerfiles, or CI/CD configuration files.
   - Ensure that the CI/CD system can handle builds and tests for different Scala versions seamlessly.

6. **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**:
   - Update the SDK documentation to reflect any changes in the build process, dependencies, or usage instructions due to cross-building.
   - Provide clear guidelines on how to build and deploy the Delta Merge functionality within the new cross-build setup.

7. **Collaboration and Integration**:
   - Collaborate closely with the team responsible for the cross-build implementation to ensure that both teams’ changes are aligned and integrated smoothly.
   - Regularly sync up with the other team to stay updated on any changes or challenges that might affect your work.

8. **Performance and Optimization**:
   - Evaluate the performance implications of the cross-build implementation and optimize your code as necessary.
   - Benchmark the Delta Merge functionality in the new setup to ensure it meets performance expectations.

9. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Review and update error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure they are effective across different build versions.

10. **Backward Compatibility**:
    - If applicable, ensure that the changes are backward-compatible with existing implementations of the SDK.

Implementing cross-build capabilities can introduce complexities, especially in a multi-team environment, so regular communication, thorough testing, and careful planning are crucial to a smooth transition.


################################

When a cross-build capability is implemented in an SDK, particularly one that's being developed by a different team, there are several aspects of rework and consideration that may need to be addressed. Here's what you might need to think about for your Delta Merge functionality:

### Potential Rework After Cross-Build Implementation:

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Update the Maven configuration files to align with the new module approach and ensure that dependencies are correctly resolved for each build target.

2. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Refactor existing code to fit into the modular structure if the cross-build setup demands separation of concerns or specific architectural patterns.

3. **Testing**:
   - Update or create new test cases to cover the cross-built artifacts, ensuring that your Delta Merge functionality behaves as expected in each build target.

4. **Build and Deployment Scripts**:
   - Modify existing build and deployment scripts to accommodate new build targets and paths introduced by the cross-build process.

5. **Configuration Changes**:
   - Adjust any configurations that might differ between build targets, such as Spark version compatibility, Scala version differences, etc.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical documentation to reflect changes in the build process and instruct users on how to build or utilize the Delta Merge functionality for different targets.

7. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Align CI/CD pipelines with cross-build strategies to ensure automated testing and deployment across different build targets.

8. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that the Delta Merge feature remains backward-compatible with previous SDK versions if necessary.

### Questions to Ask About Cross-Build Implementation:

1. **Target Scala Versions**:
   - What Scala versions will the cross-build support, and how does that impact the Delta Merge functionality?

2. **Build Process**:
   - How does the new build process work, and what steps are involved?

3. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - How are dependencies managed in the new structure, especially if different Scala versions have different binary incompatibilities?

4. **Module Structure**:
   - How are modules structured, and is there a need for the Delta Merge functionality to be split or reorganized into separate modules?

5. **Testing Strategies**:
   - How are tests handled across different Scala versions?

6. **Integration Points**:
   - Are there any specific integration points or hooks that the Delta Merge functionality needs to be aware of in the new setup?

7. **Configuration Management**:
   - How are build and runtime configurations managed for different targets?

8. **Artifact Management**:
   - How will the artifacts be named, versioned, and published for different Scala versions?

9. **Documentation**:
   - Will the cross-build process require changes to how documentation is generated or organized?

10. **Impact on Existing Features**:
    - How will existing features of the SDK be affected by the cross-build, and what testing has been done to ensure compatibility?

11. **Release Process**:
    - How does the cross-build affect the release process, and what are the steps for releasing a new version of the SDK?

12. **Migration Path**:
    - Is there a migration path or guidelines for transitioning existing code to the new cross-build system?

13. **Support and Maintenance**:
    - How will the cross-built versions be supported and maintained over time?

Understanding the answers to these questions will help your team anticipate the changes needed and integrate the Delta Merge functionality smoothly into the cross-built SDK. It's crucial to maintain open communication with the other team to address any concerns that might arise during this transition.
