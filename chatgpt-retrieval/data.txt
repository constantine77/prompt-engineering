### Functional Requirements

1. **Refined Change Detection**:
   - The API must specifically identify the addition of non-nullable columns to the dataset as a breaking change.
   - The detection mechanism should not flag other schema changes as breaking, adhering to the new definition.

2. **Schema Versioning**:
   - Maintain the existing functionality of tracking schema changes across the dataset's history in the legacy OneLake location.
   - Ensure each schema version is appropriately recorded with associated file lists.

3. **Schema Registration Enhancement**:
   - Automate the registration of schema versions, especially those with identified breaking changes, in the system catalog.

4. **Data Migration Support**:
   - Provide necessary support for migrating data associated with each version of the schema to a new OneStream location.

5. **API Output Specification**:
   - Clearly delineate and document schemas with the identified breaking changes.
   - Provide a detailed list of files corresponding to each schema version.

6. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that the API enhancements are backward compatible and do not disrupt the existing workflow or tools that depend on the API.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update Detection Algorithm**:
   - Modify the existing schema comparison algorithm to flag the addition of non-nullable columns.
   - Isolate the detection of other schema changes to ensure they are not marked as breaking under the new definition.

2. **Enhance Schema Version Tracker**:
   - Ensure the version tracking system is robust and captures the addition of non-nullable columns accurately.
   - Enhance metadata storage to document which versions contain breaking changes.

3. **Automate Schema Registration Process**:
   - Develop an automated process or script to register new schema versions flagged as breaking.
   - Implement checks to validate successful registration in the catalog.

4. **Facilitate Data Migration Workflow**:
   - Provide tools or scripts to assist in the data migration process for schemas with breaking changes.
   - Ensure the integrity of data during the migration to OneStream.

5. **Output Adjustments**:
   - Adjust the API's output modules to categorize and list breaking changes clearly.
   - Implement thorough testing to validate the accuracy of the outputs.

6. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update API documentation to reflect the new functionality and definition of breaking changes.
   - Communicate these changes to all stakeholders and update training materials as necessary.

7. **Backward Compatibility Testing**:
   - Test the enhanced API against existing workflows to ensure compatibility.
   - Provide a transition period where both the old and new API versions are available if needed.
