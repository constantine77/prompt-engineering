### Requirements

1. **Specific Detection of Breaking Changes**:
   - The API must specifically identify the addition of non-nullable columns without default values as the only breaking change.

2. **Schema Change Tracking**:
   - Continue to track schema changes across the history of the dataset in S3.
   - Track and list files associated with each version of the schema.

3. **Schema Registration**:
   - Automate the registration process of each detected schema version in the catalog.

4. **Data Migration**:
   - Facilitate the migration of data associated with each schema to a new OneStream location.

5. **API Output**:
   - The API must output a list of schemas with the specific breaking changes.
   - The API must output a list of files for each schema version.

6. **Documentation and Communication**:
   - Update the documentation to reflect the new definition of breaking changes.
   - Communicate the change to stakeholders and update any relevant training materials.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update Detection Logic**:
   - Modify the schema comparison logic to flag any new non-nullable columns as a breaking change.
   - Ensure that this is the only change that triggers the breaking change flag.

2. **Enhance Schema Tracking**:
   - Implement logic to map files to schema versions accurately.
   - Update or create new data structures to store this mapping if needed.

3. **Automate Schema Registration**:
   - Develop or update scripts that automatically register new schema versions in the catalog.
   - Include validation checks to ensure registration is successful.

4. **Streamline Data Migration**:
   - Create a process or tool to efficiently migrate data to the new OneStream location.
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency during migration.

5. **Modify API Outputs**:
   - Adjust the API's output format to clearly delineate schemas that contain the specific breaking change.
   - Ensure file lists for each schema are accurate and complete.

6. **Testing**:
   - Develop comprehensive test cases to cover the new enhancement.
   - Perform thorough testing to confirm that only the specific breaking change is detected.

7. **Rollout and Monitoring**:
   - Roll out the enhanced API in a controlled environment.
   - Monitor the API's performance and accuracy, making adjustments as needed.

8. **Documentation and Communication**:
   - Update all relevant documentation, including API guides and usage instructions.
   - Inform all stakeholders about the change and provide guidance on the implications.

9. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Establish a channel for users to report any issues or false positives/negatives.
   - Use feedback to refine the detection algorithm.
