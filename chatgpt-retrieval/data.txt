To implement Solution 1 for enhancing the existing Crawler API to focus solely on identifying the addition of non-nullable columns without default values as the only breaking change for Delta Lake, a new approach is required. The current process must be reimagined to simplify the definition of breaking changes, thereby facilitating a more streamlined and focused identification process. Below is the summary of the approach and the development steps involved:

### Summary of Solution 1:

Solution 1 necessitates a novel strategy that redefines a breaking change within the Delta Lake context to be specifically the addition of non-nullable columns without default values. This change will require a fresh logic to be developed that is capable of scanning the dataset's schema history and pinpointing instances where such changes occur.

### Development Steps for Implementation of Solution 1:

#### Design and Architecture:

1. **Define New Breaking Change Logic**:
   - Establish clear criteria and logic for what constitutes a breaking change, focusing exclusively on non-nullable columns without default values.

2. **Schema Change Detection Module**:
   - Design a new module within the Crawler API that efficiently scans through schema histories and detects the specified breaking changes.

#### Code Development:

3. **Logic Development**:
   ```scala
   // Pseudocode for the new detection logic
   def detectBreakingChanges(schemaHistory: List[Schema]): List[BreakingChange] = {
     schemaHistory.flatMap { schema =>
       schema.fields
         .filter(field => isNonNullableWithoutDefault(field))
         .map(field => BreakingChange(schema.version, field.name))
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Integration with Data Repository**:
   - Ensure the new module has access to the schema history data, potentially requiring enhancements to the data storage or retrieval mechanisms.

5. **Breaking Change Notification System**:
   - Create a notification or alert system that informs relevant stakeholders when a breaking change is detected.

#### Testing and Validation:

6. **Automated Testing Suite**:
   - Develop a comprehensive suite of automated tests that validate the breaking change detection logic against various schema evolution scenarios.

7. **Manual Testing and Review**:
   - Conduct manual reviews and testing sessions to ensure the logic accurately identifies the targeted breaking changes.

#### Deployment and Monitoring:

8. **Deployment Plan**:
   - Develop a deployment plan that includes phased rollouts, rollback strategies, and validation checkpoints.

9. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - Implement monitoring tools to observe the performance and accuracy of the new logic in a production environment.

#### Documentation and Training:

10. **Update Documentation**:
    - Revise the existing API documentation to reflect the new breaking change definition and detection process.

11. **Stakeholder Training**:
    - Train the API users, developers, and data engineers on the new breaking change logic and how to interpret its findings.

#### Continuous Improvement:

12. **Feedback Loop**:
    - Establish a feedback loop with users to continuously improve the breaking change detection logic based on real-world use cases.

By following these steps, the team can rewrite the existing Crawler API logic from scratch, focusing solely on the enhanced breaking change definition. This focused approach is expected to yield a more streamlined and maintainable system for managing Delta Lake schema evolutions.
